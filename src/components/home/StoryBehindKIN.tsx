            The Story Behind KIN
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[#020617] font-medium text-lg leading-6 text-start md:text-center">
            After 16 years as a software engineer at Microsoft, I decided to
            solve a challenge that many families face: keeping everyones
            schedules organized. With a growing family, keeping track of
            everything was a real challenge.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#020617] font-medium text-lg leading-6 mt-6 text-start md:text-center">
            KIN was born from that real-life frustration. Traditional calendars
            were too tedious and a fridge calendar wasnâ€™t available on the go.
            My goal was to create an app that makes family scheduling simple and
            accessible. Now, my wife and I can sync our schedules easily and
            finally keep our family schedule in one place.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-[#020617] font-medium text-lg leading-6 text-start md:text-center">
            I hope KIN helps your family too!
          </p>
